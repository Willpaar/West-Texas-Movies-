hey yall so we dont accidentally destory our main file
create your own branches from the main that you can code in

just go to the GitHub repo and click on branches
create a new branch there with your name

heres some basic terminal commands you might need:

link with the github:
1. change to local path
$ cd path/to/your/project

2. initialize
$ git init

3.link to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/Willpaar/West-Texas-Movies-

You should be able to pull and push from the repository now


Link local code to your own branch:
1. create branch locally
$ git checkout -b branch-name

2. set upstream so you can push and pull normally
$ git push -u origin branch-name

You can now push and pull to your own branch


Update your branch with anything new in the main without breaking your progress:
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/main


add your code to main:
1. Go to your repo on GitHub.
2. Click "Compare & pull request".
3. Make sure you're merging your-branch-name â†’ main.
4. Submit the pull request.
5. You can then click merge to officially add to main
