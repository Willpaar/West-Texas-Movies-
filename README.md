This is the template 
right now the backend folder doesnt do much 
but the frontend holds the code for the website layout

to run this locally open a terminal:
all you have to do is run the start.bat
(you made need to download the dependencies)

pretty much to sum up whats going on the index.html is the first file react will call to run the website

in that file it calls /src/main.jsx which creates a root (idk what that means) at src/app.jsx 

this app.jsx file is pretty much the main file of the whole project and it holds the routes that the website can go to
then inside the ./pages folder we will change that code to add whatever webpages we will need

then inside the ./components folder we will put simple templates for items on the webpage like headers, footers, ect.

not 100% what ./assets is for yet

the ./frontend/public folder will hold images that the website will use

just lmk if you have any questions about anything else in here ill try to answer it
