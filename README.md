This is the template 
right now the backend folder doesnt do much 
but the frontend holds the code for the website layout

to run this locally open a terminal:
cd ../path_to_folder/frontend
npm run dev
(you made need to download the dependencies)

pretty much to sum up whats going on the frontend/src/app.jsx file holds the routes that the website can go to
then inside the ./pages folder we will change that code to add whatever webpages we will need

then inside the ./components folder we will put simple templates for items on the webpage like headers, footers, ect.

not 100% what assets is for yet

the ./frontend/public folder will hold images that the website will use

just lmk if you have any questions about anything else in here ill try to answer it
